This year, Numina and Hugging Face collaborated to compete in the 1st Progress Prize of theÂ [AI Math Olympiad (AIMO)](https://aimoprize.com/).
This competition involved fine-tuning open LLMs to solve difficult math problems that high school students use to train for the International Math Olympiad. Weâ€™re excited to share that our model â€”Â **[NuminaMath 7B TIR](https://huggingface.co/AI-MO/NuminaMath-7B-TIR)**Â â€” was the winner and managed to solve 29 out of 50 problems on the private test set ðŸ¥³!

In this blog post, we introduce the Numina initiative and the technical details behind our winning solution. If you want to skip straight to testing the model, check out ourÂ [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AI-MO/math-olympiad-solver).
